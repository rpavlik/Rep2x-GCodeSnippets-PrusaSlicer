The Y home offset is correct if\n;   the initial extrusion performed by this code is at 3mm from the front edge of the bed.\n; IMPORTANT: ensure "Use relative E distances" is enabled in Printer settings.\n; Tips for better dual extrusion quality:\n; 1. Use my dualstrusion-postproc script version 1.0 or newer:\n;    https://github.com/DrLex0/DualstrusionPostproc\n;    It optimizes the file for much better results on printers like the FFCP.\n; 2. Enable a skirt up to the tallest layer that has two materials, and set minimum skirt\n;    extrusion length to have at least 3 loops in the first layer.\n; 3. Ensure nozzles are clean: no oozed filament and no gunk stuck to them.\n;\n;SUMMARY\n;\n;first layer temperature (right) = [first_layer_temperature_0]C\n;first layer temperature (left) =
